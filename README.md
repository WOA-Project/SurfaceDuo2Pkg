# Project Mu UEFI Implementation for Surface Duo 2

## Build

Quick notes for building:

- Use Ubuntu 20.04 x64
- Generate ACPI tables with IASL
- Follow this quick draft

NOTE: The build scripts were designed to run in a CI, take inspiration from them, but the behavior on installs with compilers already installed/env vars set is undefined.

```
# Setup environment
sudo ./setup_env.sh

# Activate Workspace
python3 -m venv SurfaceDuo2
source SurfaceDuo2/bin/activate

# Stamp
./build_releaseinfo.ps1

# Build UEFI
pip install --upgrade -r pip-requirements.txt
./build_uefi.sh

# Generate ELF image
./build.sh
```
